# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Introduction to AWS Machine Learning Final Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting bike-sharing demand using the AutoGluon library for the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle. By utilizing tabular prediction techniques, we aim to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. The project demonstrates proficiency in using AutoGluon to train multiple models and optimizing solutions for the given problem.

Bike-sharing demand prediction is crucial for companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, as it helps them prepare for spikes in their services and improve customer experience by minimizing delays.

In the end, the project involves submitting multiple entries to the competition and achieving a rank within Kaggle. Additionally, a detailed report of findings will be compiled, which can be shared publicly on Kaggle or personal platforms to showcase the work done.



## Getting Started
* Clone this template repository `git clone git@github.com:udacity/nd009t-c1-intro-to-ml-project-starter.git` into AWS Sagemaker Studio (or local development).
